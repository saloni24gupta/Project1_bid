Thanks for the update! You're **almost done** — the certificate generation failed **only because OpenSSL couldn't find its config file** (`openssl.cnf`). This is common with XAMPP because OpenSSL isn't always preconfigured correctly.

Let’s fix this and re-run the cert generation.

## ✅ Fix OpenSSL Error in XAMPP

### 🔧 Step 1: Create/Open `openssl.cnf`

1. Navigate to:

   ```
   C:\xampp\apache\conf\
   ```

2. Create a file called:

   ```
   openssl.cnf
   ```

3. Paste the following basic config:

```ini
# Minimal openssl.cnf for XAMPP

[ req ]
default_bits        = 2048
distinguished_name  = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions      = v3_req
x509_extensions     = v3_req
prompt              = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
C = IN
ST = Delhi
L = Delhi
O = Clavax
OU = 150
CN = saloni.cladev.com

[ v3_req ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = saloni.cladev.com
```

✅ This makes OpenSSL happy without prompts.

### 🔧 Step 2: Re-run OpenSSL with Config

Now, run this manually in PowerShell (inside `C:\xampp\apache\bin`):

```powershell
.\openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 `
  -newkey rsa:2048 `
  -keyout "C:\xampp\apache\conf\ssl.key\saloni.key" `
  -out "C:\xampp\apache\conf\ssl.crt\saloni.crt" `
  -config "C:\xampp\apache\conf\openssl.cnf"
```

If successful, it will generate:

* `saloni.key` → private key
* `saloni.crt` → self-signed cert with SAN for `saloni.cladev.com`

---

### 🔁 Step 3: Restart Apache from XAMPP

* Open **XAMPP Control Panel**
* Click **Stop**, then **Start** on Apache
* If Apache fails to start, check `logs/error.log`

---

### 🌐 Step 4: Test in Browser

Visit:

```
https://saloni.cladev.com
```

🔒 It should load over HTTPS! Accept the self-signed certificate warning once.

---

## 🧩 Bonus (Optional): Sanity Check

To confirm Apache is serving the cert:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect saloni.cladev.com:443 -servername saloni.cladev.com
```

You’ll see the certificate details printed in terminal (if using WSL or Git Bash).
